**BitDevs Zambia** is a community of Bitcoiners in Zambia focused on exploring the technical side of Bitcoin. Inspired by the original BitDevs NYC, we host meetups, workshops, and study groups to deepen our understanding of Bitcoinâ€™s protocol, Lightning Network, privacy tools, Bitcoin-related development, and local use cases.

We welcome developers, builders, educators, entrepreneurs, students, and anyone curious about how Bitcoin works under the hood and how it can be applied to solve real challenges in Zambia.

### What We Do

- **Bootcamps**: A structured program combining education, collaboration, and practical building to grow Bitcoin technical skills in Zambia.
- **Technical Discussion Meetups**: Regular Socratic Seminars covering the latest Bitcoin technology, research, BIPs, and implementation updates.
- **Workshops & Hackathons**: Hands-on sessions for developers and technologists to build local Bitcoin solutions.
- **Reading Groups**: Deep dives into Bitcoin technical literature.
- **Collaborative Projects**: Support for open-source Bitcoin development in the Zambian context.

### Socratic Seminars

Our seminars are structured to encourage deep discussion and learning around Bitcoinâ€™s protocol, development tools, privacy improvements, and emerging ideas in the ecosystem. Each session features curated topics drawn from BitDevs mailing lists, Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), GitHub PRs, research papers, and open-source development updates.

Participants are encouraged to read in advance and come with questions or ideas to share. These events are not recorded â€” they are meant to be informal, candid, and engaging.

Some sessions include lightning talks, hands-on demos, or breakout discussions. We also create a safe space for beginners to ask questions and learn alongside more experienced contributors.
