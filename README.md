# BitDevs-Gitega
BitDevs Gitega is a Bitcoin Gitega initiative to foster Bitcoin development, education, and open-source collaboration in Gitega. Inspired by global BitDevs communities, this project provides a local space for developers, researchers, and Bitcoin enthusiasts to study and contribute to Bitcoin's protocol and ecosystem.
